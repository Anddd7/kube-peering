# v0 - startup

Entity

- Local: the developer machine hosts the local environment
- Local Application: the application runs locally (binary, docker)
- Cluster: the remote kubernetes cluster in cloud/internet
- Remote Application: the running pod/deployment of the application in cluster

Component

- kpctl: installed in local, init the connection with kpeering, forward the traffic locally
- kpeering: installed in cluster, accept the connection with kpctl and listen to app port to forward the traffic
  - service, cluster <-> remote app (kpeering)
  - backdoor, remote app (kpeering) <-> local app (kpctl)

similar like an vpn, installed in both cluster/pod and local/application
